# Coldplay Analysis

## Overview

This analysis explores trends in Coldplay's discography using Spotify audio features, focusing on the relationships between energy and tempo, danceability over time, and valence versus speechiness. Key findings show a positive correlation between energy and tempo, stable danceability across years, and a broad emotional range (valence) with minimal use of spoken-word elements (speechiness).
